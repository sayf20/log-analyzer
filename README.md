# 🔐 Password & SSH Log Analyzer

A beginner-friendly yet powerful Python-based cybersecurity tool that analyzes SSH authentication logs (`auth.log`) to detect brute-force attempts, failed/successful logins, and visualize attack patterns — with a web dashboard!

---

## 📂 Features

✅ Analyze `auth.log` for:

- Failed login attempts per IP
- Successful logins per IP
- Usernames involved in attacks
- Timestamps of login events
- Brute-force behavior detection

✅ CLI Summary View:

- Colored real-time summary in terminal using `colorama`
- Sorted IPs, user activity, and login statistics

✅ 🌐 Web Dashboard (Flask + Chart.js + Custom CSS):

- **Drag-and-drop log file uploader** for a seamless experience
- Beautiful **dark-themed dashboard** UI with clear visual hierarchy
- Live charts:
  - Failed login attempts per IP
  - Successful logins per user/IP
- Tables summarizing:
  - Failed & successful login counts
  - Users targeted or successfully authenticated
  - Login time history per IP
- Responsive and clean cyber-themed design
